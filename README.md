Welcome to this tutorial where you'll learn how to map deforestation using Global Forest Change data (2001-2023) from GLAD. In this repo, we'll cover:  
   1. Fetching forest cover and tree loss data for your region of interest.
   2. Reclassifying raster files into periods.
   3. Creating powerful maps with tidyterra and ggplot2.
